      <description>Part of my computational research examines methods for modeling spread on networks. This work applies to several pathogens, including white-nose syndrome in bats, Ebola in central and west Africa, and SARS-Cov2. By modeling the epidemics on a network, we can better capture the pattern of spread, identify key factors influencing that pattern, and produce effective forecasts. My current work addresses two important problems: simplifying the complex networks that often result from these models and coupling processes at the local scale to macro-scale spread on the network.</description>

      <description>Graduate student openings (Ph.D./M.S.) in Population and Community Ecology The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking motivated graduate students (Ph.D. or M.S.) to study the dynamics of extinction, species invasions, and/or species coexistence. The lab uses a combination of laboratory and field experiments, quantitative models, and computational analysis of big datasets to address basic and applied questions about population dynamics and persistence.</description>
