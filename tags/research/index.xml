      <description>The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking motivated graduate students (Ph.D. or M.S.) to study the dynamics of extinction, species invasions, and/or species coexistence. The lab uses a combination of laboratory and field experiments, quantitative models, and computational analysis of big datasets to address basic and applied questions about population dynamics and persistence. Potential study systems range from zooplankton to microbes to emerging wildlife diseases.</description>

      <title>Graduate student opening (Ph.D./M.S.) - Spatial ecology of invasive species</title>
      <link>https://kramera3.github.io/post/recruiting2nd2018/</link>

      <description>The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking a graduate student to study the spatial dynamics of invasive species using computational approaches, including machine learning and species distribution models. Research in the lab includes the population ecology of invasion, extinction and species coexistence. This project will build on previous work on forecasting potential invaders and patterns of spatial spread. Applicants interested in species distribution models, spatial dynamics, or aquatic invasive species are particularly encouraged to apply.</description>

      <description>I have contributed substantially to the development of this website (http://zooplankton.ecology.uga.edu) from the Drake Laboratory of Population Dynamics at the University of Georgia that provides interested researchers and educators with access to our publicly available dataset. The variety and abundance of data is communicated via interactive visualizations custom developed in Javascript. It includes 17,596 lines of open data on 485,047 zooplankton specimens representing 133 taxa collected from Carolina Bays of the Savannah River Site.</description>
