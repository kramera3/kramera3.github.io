      <description>MSc opportunity - Population ecology of invasive species The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking a graduate student to study the spatial dynamics of invasive species using computational approaches, beginning in August 2018. Research in the lab includes the population ecology of invasion, extinction and species coexistence. This project will build on previous work on forecasting potential invaders and patterns of spatial spread.</description>

      <description>Graduate student openings (Ph.D./M.S.) in Population and Community Ecology The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking motivated graduate students (Ph.D. or M.S.) to study the dynamics of extinction, species invasions, and/or species coexistence. The lab uses a combination of laboratory and field experiments, quantitative models, and computational analysis of big datasets to address basic and applied questions about population dynamics and persistence.</description>
