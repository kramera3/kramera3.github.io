The Kramer lab will soon be recruiting a postdoc and PhD student to work on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among multiple hosts in ecological communities. This work will advance theory of how ecological interactions modulate zoonotic disease transmission based on differing interactions and susceptibilities.
