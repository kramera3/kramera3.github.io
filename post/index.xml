      <title>Global economic costs of aquatic invasive alien species</title>
      <link>https://kramera3.github.io/post/stotenpub2021/</link>

      <description>We use the Invacost database to aggregate reported economic costs of aquatic invasive species. Aquatic invasions have cost the global economy more than $345 billion dollars, with most of those costs due to invertebrates. Evidence suggests these costs are severely underestimated.

      <title>Deep learning and ecological time series</title>
      <link>https://kramera3.github.io/post/eipub2021/</link>

      <description>We provide an accessible framework for applying deep learning methods for classifying time series to ecological questions. Using mcfly and TensorFlow, we demonstrate the value of these approaches for species distribution models, phenological predictions, and species identification from wingbeat spectra.

      <description>Extending congratulations and our best wishes to Wei Chen for accepting a Masters research position at UCF. Wei will begin Fall 2021 and work in the Marine Ecology and Conservation Lab with Dr. Geoffrey Cook.
In the Kramer lab, Wei assisted with zooplankton field sampling and sample processing. He also completed an independent research project on the impact of land use on the distribution of freshwater zooplankton in the Tampa Bay area.</description>

      <title>Invacost R package available</title>

      <description>This R package provides access to the Invacost database and several methods for using and analyzing the data. This includes standardizing costs and estimating trends over time. The database is the most complete source for information on economic costs of invasive species published in peer-reviewed and grey literature, across several languages.

      <description>Alexander is dual majoring in mathematics and microbiology, with a minor in Russian. In general, he is interested in disease ecology and how it relates to epidemiology. In the lab, Alexander will begin assisting our Masters student, Travis Flock, in conducting a meta-analysis on trait-mediated interactions.
We are happy to have Alexander join our team and excited to see how his interests will contribute to our lab!</description>

      <description>The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking motivated graduate students (Ph.D. or M.S.) to study the dynamics of extinction, species invasions, and/or species coexistence. The lab uses a combination of laboratory and field experiments, quantitative models, and computational analysis of big datasets to address basic and applied questions about population dynamics and persistence. Potential study systems range from zooplankton to microbes to emerging wildlife diseases.</description>

      <description>The Kramer laboratory in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida is seeking a graduate student to study the spatial dynamics of invasive species using computational approaches, including machine learning and species distribution models. Research in the lab includes the population ecology of invasion, extinction and species coexistence. This project will build on previous work on forecasting potential invaders and patterns of spatial spread. Applicants interested in species distribution models, spatial dynamics, or aquatic invasive species are particularly encouraged to apply.</description>

      <description>I have contributed substantially to the development of this website (http://zooplankton.ecology.uga.edu) from the Drake Laboratory of Population Dynamics at the University of Georgia that provides interested researchers and educators with access to our publicly available dataset. The variety and abundance of data is communicated via interactive visualizations custom developed in Javascript. It includes 17,596 lines of open data on 485,047 zooplankton specimens representing 133 taxa collected from Carolina Bays of the Savannah River Site.</description>
