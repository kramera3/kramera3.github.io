      <description>Austin Joined the lab in November 2018
Austin completed both his B.A. (mathematics, 2013) and M.S. (interdisciplinary ecology, 2018) at the University of Florida. His research interests include implementing mathematical/statistical techniques to ecological data in order to understand species invasions, niche structure/ habitat suitability, and population dynamics. Austin&amp;rsquo;s previous research efforts involved model optimization techniques, utilizing machine learning algorithms for defining habitat quality of introduced game birds, and analyzing the effects of propagule size on release attempts.</description>

      <description>Travis joined the lab in 2018.
I am mostly interested in reviewing and synthesizing published literature to conduct meta-analyses and database-driven research. My current Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis is using a meta-analysis to examine the costs of trait-mediated interactions and indirect effects relative to the density-mediated/consumptive effects of consumer-resource dynamics. Past research efforts that I have been involved in include, investigating the effects of octopamine in modulating defensive, antipredator behavior in scorpions, and using a database approach to investigate whether glucocorticoids in adult, wildlife populations were predictive of IUCN-labeled conservation status.</description>

      <description>Low density populations can be subject to Allee effects, also known as positive density dependence, which result in reduced population growth rate and increased risk of extinction in small populations. These dynamics are crucial to the success of invasive species, management of harvested populations and conservation of threatened and endangered species. My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms and consequences of positive density dependence, which is important in aquatic species from sea urchins to salmon to copepods.</description>

      <title>Aquatic invasive species</title>

      <description>A current focus of my research is forecasting the potential distributions of invasive species in the Great Lakes. These species included current invaders like Eurasian ruffe and potential future invaders such as the golden mussel, (Limnoperna fortunei) and killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus). I am using a combination of parametric and non-parametric models, including application of novel machine learning approaches. In addition to commonly considered climatic predictors the forecasts integrate extensive spatial data on Great Lakes habitat.</description>

      <title>Macroscale spread of disease</title>
      <link>https://kramera3.github.io/project/disease-spread/</link>

      <description>Part of my computational research examines methods for modeling spread on networks. This work focuses on the past and future spread of white-nose syndrome, a devastating disease of bats, in North America. By modeling the epidemic on a network, we have shown that the risk of spread between counties depends on a combination of distance, cave density and climate (Maher et al. 2012). These results have contributed to management decisions for affected species, and generated valuable insights about how the spatial spread of Ebola virus in West Africa can be predicted by evaluating alternative epidemic paths.</description>

      <title>Zooplankton Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://kramera3.github.io/project/zooplankton-communities/</link>

      <description>There is much room for improving understanding of the contribution of interspecific interactions, such as competition and predation, to extinction risk. I am continuing work in Sierra Nevada zooplankton populations, with a proposed project to examine how rapid changes in phenotype mediate coexistence between competitors. I am also working to explain why temporary wetlands at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory are able to support a hyper-diverse zooplankton community.
The work at the Savannah River Ecology lab includes analysis of community structure in an existing medium-term dataset on zooplankton communities.</description>
